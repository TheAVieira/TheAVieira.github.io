						<h1>Arthur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vieira</h1>
						<h3>Robotic Instruments | Physics Engineering</h3>
						<p> Hi! You've landed on my portfolio page. Here I showcase my work and experiences in a multitude of techincal domains, as well thoughts and ideas.</p>
						<p> Actually, one of my challenges is to define what I do, as I have endless intersts. In short, I'm enthusiastic about technology and how to used it to improve society. 
							That sounds too clichÃ©. Another way of saying it is that everything that we do: scientific research, products and services, culture, and arts. It's all done for
							people. It is all done for us and those around us.</p>
						<p><b>So, why take a PhD?</b> That is indeed a good question. No point denying that education is of major importance in a society, as everyone who is born has to learn 
							everything again. But a PhD is more than just learning. It is also about contribuiting to expanding human knowledge, learning how to be effective at identifying 
							and producing novelty, and it is also about honing in my own skills, technical and otherwise.</p>

						<h2>Through drop-imaging | PhD</h2>
						<p>I invented and developed a class of novel robotic instrument for surface wetting characterization, at the Robotic Instruments group, at Aalto University, Finland.
							The novelty lies in observing the wetting interce through the droplet itself.</p>
						<p>In the process I also invented a new method to characterize advancing and receding contact angles on single-fibers. Turns out the "most obvious idea" had not been before 
							and required some engineering.
						</p>
						<p><b>Hardware:</b> I built an instrument to it. It integrates precision motorized stages; machine vision cameras; a laser interferometer; a liquid dispenser and more.</p>
						<p><b>Software:</b> I rewrote the mixed-language platform (C#, Python, Lua) of our research group. This included writing low level code such as quadrature (sin/cos) decoding, 
							real-time and offline image analysis in python and MATLAB. </p>

						<h2>Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) | Masters</h2>
						<p>I also developed a functioning AFM from sctrach. This was the topic of my Master's thesis. It also included the opearting software. 
							The goal was to develop a low-cost AFM to extend the capabilities of the Atomic Force Microscopy and Related Techniques laboratory at the 
							Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. </p>
						<p><b>Hardware:</b> The AFM was developed in about 5 months during as the topic of my Master thesis. </p>
						<p><b>Software:</b> The operating software was developed on-and-off during my Master's degree in a period of about 2 years. I estimated that
							the software was developed in about 9 months equivalent time of full-time work.</p>

									<h3>Humidity control system</h3>
									<span class="image fit imageflipperFade">
										<!-- TODO - Edit all images the same size. -->

									</span>
									<p>
										The goals was to control the Relative Humidity (RH) of any enclosure in our laboratory supporting a diverse set of 
										experiments. To do this I started by considering the use of a CEM (Controlled Evaporator Mixer), including mass flow 
										controlers for dry air and water. The CEM vaporizes the water into the dry air at a controlled ratio producing an output air 
										at any Relative Humidity. Turns out this would have been an over-engineered solution and quite expensive.
									</p>
									<p> Instead I built a bubbler system. Dry air is bubbled through water to produce saturated air (the water needs to be
										heated to reach 100% RH or higher, i.e. oversaturated air).
										Then, two manual flow valves control the ratio of the flow of dry and humid air to be mixed. Turns out the system
										is quite repeatable and predictable. This means, you can calculate the final RH based on the ratio of dry and humid 
										air and the same result is obtained each time.  temperature and RH sensor is also used to monitor the state of the enclosure.
										I was very happy with the acrylic support structure that makes the device portable. It was design in CAD laser-cut to order.
										The water bottle is also surprisingly secure in place.

									<h3>Winter lighting lighting solution</h3>
									<p>

											<img src="Resources/WinterLigthing/WinterLighting_LightsWarm.png" alt="" />
											<img src="Resources/WinterLigthing/WinterLighting_ThePlan.png" alt="" />
										</span>
										The goal was to create a lighting solution that would light up at dawn and evening in winter time, replacing the missing hours 
										of sun. However, it is not that simple. Here is how the device should work: 
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Morning cycle:</b> In a winter day, at some prescribed hour at dawn, the lights dim up emulating a sunrise. The lights start 
										with warm color and turn cold as the hours pass. Then the lights fade out when the actual sun comes up.
										</br>
										<b>Dawn cycle:</b> At some prescribed hour at dusk, the lights dim up, replacing the setting sun. The lights start 
										with cold color. Then, as the hours pass, the lights turn warm and slowly dim emulating a sunset.
										</br>
										The electronics should be plugged in at the end of summer and unplugged during the winter.
									</p>
									<p> To make this project I bought the LED strips and mounted them to aluminum profile bars atop my window hangers. 
										I needed a microcontroller with WiFi capability to synchronize the internal watch, so I used an ESP8266MOD I had lying around.
										I did a bunch of research on day-time hours and made several calculations. The device was ready at the end of summer of 2020, some two
										weeks before the date when it would first turn on (i.e. daylight hours were low enough.). I put the project on pause for two weeks.
										When the time came, I plugged the device and started testing . I made the device work with basic functionality but realized that to test it
										I would need to either collect data on device operation over a whole year or develop a testing methodology to simulate different days of the year and times of day.
										</br>
										In the end, I let the device work for a few days to see how I felt with the light comming on at the prescribed hours. But soon enough the 
										AMS1117 LDO voltage regulator that powered the ESP8266MOD burned out. I suspect that the soldering process made the regulator bad. That can happen when 
										you try to solder a SMD onto a perf-board ðŸ˜‚.

									<h3>Puzzle Box</h3>

										</span>
										A simple 3D printed puzzle box. My goal was to design an elegant puzzle-box with focus on aesthetics, especially surface finish. Nonetheless, the design of the locking mechanism had to be optimized, including steel pins and magents. I must have made around 20 prototypes and produced around 10 units gifted to friends. Many hours were spent on sanding, polishing, painting and airbrushing.
									</p>
									<p>For CAD design I typically work with SolidWorks, but for this one I wanted to try something different, so I went with Fusion 360.</p>
