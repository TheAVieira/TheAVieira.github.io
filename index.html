				<h3>Robotic Devices | Physics Engineering </h3>
				<p> Hi! You've landed on my portfolio page. Here I showcase some of my work and experiences in a
					multitude of technical domains, as well as some thoughts and ideas.</p>
				<p> Currently I'm a <b>Project Specialist</b> in an R2B project developing a medical device. I'd love to talk more about, but some of the details are still under development. 
					Contact me if you are curious about it. </p>
				<p> Regarding my whole career it is a bit challenging to define what I do, as I have endless interests. In short, I'm
					enthusiastic about technology and how to used it to improve society. My focus has been building precision smart devices from specialized 
					scientific instrumentation to smart medical devices. </p>

				<h2>Turnkey project delivery - Single fiber wetting characterization </h2>
				<p>After my PhD I was invited by our collaborators to replicate the device and method I developed for measuring the wetting properties of single-fibers.
					I developed the method as a side-quest during my PhD. And that side-quest turned into a Best Conference Paper award at MARSS2023 and then into a serious application case.
					It so happened our collaborators were highly in need of an instrument capable of measuring the wetting properties of single-fiber. 
					They are trying to modify the wetting properties of fibers and had no effective means of measuring them.
				</p>
				<p><b>Hardware:</b> I streamlined the hardware used in my device. Simplified the probe making it more robust and minimizing its micro-assembly procedure. </p>
				<p><b>Software:</b> I used the control software I rewrote from our group as control software (C#, Python, Lua). I wrote the device control code so the user would have 
					comprehensive control over the device. I also rewrote the analysis software and made it more robust than before.  </p>
				<p><b>Documentation and User training:</b> A significant part of the time was used to produce comprehensive documentation and train the team in using the device.
					 Every usage aspect needed to be documented, e.g., device assembly and hardware, control software and usage protocols with examples of expected results.</p>

				<h2>Through drop-imaging | PhD</h2>
				<p>I invented and developed a class of novel robotic instrument for surface wetting characterization, at
					the Robotic Instruments group, Aalto University, Finland.
					The novelty lies in observing the wetting interface through the droplet itself which allows 40x better contact-angle 
					resolution in super-repellent surfaces, compared to conventional methods. </p>
				<p>In the process I also invented a new method to characterize advancing and receding contact angles on
					single-fibers. Turns out the "most obvious idea" had not been done before and required some engineering.
				</p>
				<p><b>Hardware:</b> I built an instrument to do it. It integrates precision motorized stages; machine
					vision cameras; a laser interferometer; a liquid dispenser and much more.</p>
				<p><b>Software:</b> I rewrote the mixed-language platform of our research group (C#, Python, Lua). This
					included writing low level code such as quadrature (sin/cos) decoding,
					real-time and offline image analysis in python and MATLAB. </p>

				<h2>Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) | Masters</h2>
				<p>I also developed a functioning AFM instrument from scratch. This was the topic of my Master's thesis.
					It also included the operating software.
					The goal was to develop a low-cost AFM to extend the capabilities of the Atomic Force Microscopy and
					Related Techniques laboratory at the
					Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. </p>
				<p><b>Hardware:</b> The AFM was developed in about 5 months as the topic of my Master thesis. </p>
				<p><b>Software:</b> The operating software was developed on-and-off during my Master's degree in a
					period of about 2 years. I estimated
					the software development took about 9 months of equivalent full-time work.</p>

							<h3>Humidity control system</h3>
							<span class="image fit imageflipperFade">
								<!-- TODO - Edit all images the same size. -->
								<img src="Resources/RHSystem/RHSystem_Device.png" alt="">

							</span>
							<p>
								The goals was to control the Relative Humidity (RH) of any enclosure in our laboratory
								supporting a diverse set of
								experiments. To do this I started by considering the use of a CEM (Controlled Evaporator
								Mixer), including mass flow
								controllers for dry air and water. The CEM vaporizes the water into the dry air in
								precisely controlled ratio producing an output air
								at any RH. Turns out this would have been an over-engineered solution and quite
								expensive.
							</p>
							<p> Instead I built a bubbler system. Dry air is bubbled through water to produce close to
								saturated air, ~80% RH.
								Higher RH levels can be achieved by heating the water.
								Then, two manual flow valves control the ratio of the flow of dry and humid air to be
								mixed. The system resulted to be
								quite repeatable and predictable. This means, you can calculate the final RH based on
								the ratio of dry and humid
								air and the same result is obtained each time. temperature and RH sensor is also used to
								monitor the state of the enclosure.
								I was very happy with the acrylic support structure that makes the device portable. It
								was design in CAD laser-cut to order.
								The water bottle is also surprisingly secure in place.

							<h3>Winter lighting solution</h3>
							<span class="image fit imageflipperFade">

								<img src="Resources/WinterLigthing/WinterLighting_LightsWarm.png" alt="" />
								<img src="Resources/WinterLigthing/WinterLighting_ThePlan.png" alt="" />
							</span>
							<p>
								The goal was to create a lighting solution that would light-up at dawn and dusk in
								winter time, replacing the missing hours
								of sun. However, it is not that simple. Here is how the device works:
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Dawn cycle:</b> In a winter day, at some prescribed hour at dawn, the lights dim up
								slowly, emulating a sunrise. The lights start
								with warm color and turn cold as the hours pass. Then the lights fade out when the
								actual sun comes up.
								</br>
								<b>Dusk cycle:</b> At some prescribed hour at dusk, the lights dim up, replacing the
								setting sun. The lights start
								with cold color. Then, as the hours pass, the lights turn warm and slowly fade out
								emulating a sunset.
								</br>
							</p>
							<p> To make this project I bought the LED strips and mounted them to aluminum profile bars
								atop my window hangers.
								For the control circuit, I needed a microcontroller with WiFi capability to synchronize
								the internal watch with a reference time. So I used an ESP8266MOD I had in my electronics bins.
								I did a bunch of research on daylight hours and made several calculations. The device
								was ready at the end of summer of 2020, some two weeks before the date when it would first 
								turn on (i.e. daylight hours were low enough). So, I put the project on pause for two weeks.
								When the time came, I plugged the device and started testing. I made the device work
								with basic functionality but realized that to test it I would need to either collect data on
								device operation over a whole year or develop a testing methodology to simulate different days
								of the year and times of day.
								</br>
								In the end, I left the device work for a few days to see how I felt with the light coming
								on at the prescribed hours. But soon enough the AMS1117 LDO voltage regulator that powered the
								ESP8266MOD burned out. I suspect that the soldering process made the regulator bad. That can happen
								when you try to solder a SMD onto a perf-board 😂.
							</p>
							<p> Maybe one day I will come back to this project.</p>

							<h3>Puzzle Box</h3>
							<span class="image fit imageflipperFade">
								<img src="Resources/PuzzleBox/Real_Open.jpg" alt="" />
								<img src="Resources/PuzzleBox/Real_Closed.jpg" alt="" />

							</span>
							<p>
								A simple 3D printed puzzle box. The challenge is to open the box. My goal was to design
								an elegant puzzle-box with focus on aesthetics, especially surface finish. Nonetheless,
								the design of the locking mechanism had to be optimized, including steel parts and
								magnets. I must have made around 20 prototypes and produced around 10 units, most of them
								gifted to friends. Many hours were spent on sanding, polishing, painting and
								airbrushing.
							</p>
							<p>
								The piece is minimalist. The symmetric shape of box is broken by a fine white line that
								helps keep the user oriented. On one of the sides there is some alien-looking text that 
								further breaks symmetry. The text instructs on how to open the box. If you can read it.
								The puzzle is considered solved when you have opened it and have deciphered the text. On
								the inside you'll find my maker's logo, which are my initials 'AV' written with same characters.
								Size: 50 x 50 x 23 mm.
							</p>
							<p>
								For CAD design I typically work with SolidWorks, but for this project I wanted to try
								something different, so I went with Fusion 360. The parts are printed on an Elegoo Mars
								resin printer, then assembled and tested manually followed by surface finish.
